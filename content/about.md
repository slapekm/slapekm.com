Hi there! Welcome to my personal corner of the internet! I'm **Mariusz Słapek**, a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about AI, technology, and continuous learning.

I specialize in building intelligent systems and exploring cutting-edge developments in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Machine Learning**. On this blog, I’ll be sharing interesting insights, technical deep dives, and thoughts on the latest trends in Artificial Intelligence.


When I’m not behind the screen, you’ll probably find me:

* 🏃‍♂️ On the football pitch or a padel court.
* ⛵ Out on the water, pursuing my love for sailing.
* 📚 Learning new things and staying curious
