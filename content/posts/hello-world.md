Hi there! Welcome to my personal corner of the internet.

I'm a **Machine Learning Engineer** with a passion for building intelligent systems and exploring the ever-evolving world of **AI and technology**. While my days are often spent deep in data and algorithms, I believe in a life balanced by movement and adventure.

On this blog, I’ll be sharing interesting insights, technical deep dives, and thoughts on the latest trends in Artificial Intelligence.

When I’m not behind the screen, you’ll probably find me:
* 🏃‍♂️ On the **football** pitch or a **padel** court.
* ⛵ Out on the water, pursuing my love for **sailing**.

Stay tuned for more tech-focused content coming soon!
